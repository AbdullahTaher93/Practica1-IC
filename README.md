# Practica1-IC

## Description  

The purpose of this Practice is solving a pattern recognition problem using artificial neural networks, we will evaluate by using  several types of neural networks to solve a  Handwritten Digit Recognition problem. using  [MNIST]( http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) database.

### Neural Networks introduction 

Neural networks are used as a method of deep learning, one of the many subfields of artificial intelligence. They were first proposed around 70 years ago as an attempt at simulating the way the human brain works, though in a much more simplified form. Individual ‘neurons’ are connected in layers, with weights assigned to determine how the neuron responds when signals are propagated through the network. Previously, neural networks were limited in the number of neurons they were able to simulate, and therefore the complexity of learning they could achieve. But in recent years, due to advancements in hardware development, we have been able to build very deep networks, and train them on enormous datasets to achieve breakthroughs in machine intelligence.

These breakthroughs have allowed machines to match and exceed the capabilities of humans at performing certain tasks. One such task is object recognition. Though machines have historically been unable to match human vision, recent advances in deep learning have made it possible to build neural networks which can recognize objects, faces, text, and even emotions.
